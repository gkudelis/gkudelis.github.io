I've been feeling I should set up a blog for a while now. I do odd projects
from time to time and before this I had no place to document them. Well, while
staying at Budapest I decided I should finally sort this out.

I wanted to make it using some sort of static pages generator as I don't think
it needs any kind of functionality really and if it will I should be able to
get away with javascript.  I picked hakyll to do static pages with as I was
learning haskell and hey, why not? It's been a bit of a pain, but I got the
basic stuff running. 

The whole thing is on github.io as it seems to be a good platform for this sort
of thing.

I'm already thinking what to post about next and there's a backlog of projects
I should write up, so this will start expanding soon.
