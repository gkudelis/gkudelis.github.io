title: Getting Google Analytics

Today I figured I'd like to have some idea if people actually ever visit this
place and if so - why. Google Analytics can give you visibility of your users
and gives a breakdown of how people found your site. It's also really easy to
set it up, so I decided to go for it.

I set up a new Google Analytics account, pointed it to this site, copied the JS
script provided and pasted in the bottom of the base template. Little did I
know that it's supposed to be inside `<head>` tags... After refreshing the site
a bunch of times, waiting for about an hour, refreshing again and still not
seeing anything in the real-time reporting area I was told what to do. It turns
out it says that in the documentation as well, but not on the page you copy the
JS code from.

Pretty much immediately after that everything started working and I can now
see all the traffic. Or lack thereof.
