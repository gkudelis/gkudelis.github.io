Hello! My name is Giedrius Kudelis. I am a software engineer with experience
in web development and enthusiasm for [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture).
This site is a repository of things I find interesting and want to write up
as well as a place to find my contacts. The best way by far to reach me is to
email me.
