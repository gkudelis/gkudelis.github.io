Hello! My name is Giedrius Kudelis. I am a software engineer with experience
in web development. I'm interested in data science and machine learning in
particular, I enjoy learning programming languages and participating in hackathons.
This site is a repository of projects I find interesting and want to write up
as well as a place to share my contacts. The best way by far to reach me is to
email me.
