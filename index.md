Hello! My name is Giedrius Kudelis. I am a software engineer with experience
in full-stack web development. I enjoy learning programming languages
(exploring Rust at the moment), doing electronics projects (as well as writing
some embedded code), thinking about human-computer interaction and trying to
wrap my head around concurrent/parallel computation.

This site is a repository of projects I find interesting and want to write up
as well as a place to share my contacts.
